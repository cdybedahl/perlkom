Net::Lyskom version 1.2
=======================

This is a module for talking to Lyskom servers. See
http://www.lysator.liu.se/lyskom/ for more information on those. It's
installed in the usual way:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Documentation is available via perldoc as usual. Some knowledge about
how the Lyskom system works will be needed, and for more than trivial
applications a working knowledge of Protocol A is pretty much
necessary. For trivial applications, have a look at
Net::Lyskom::Simple (which is a part of this package).

For questions, comments and bug reports, try to use the "Perlkom"
conference at kom.lysator.liu.se. If that's difficult, send mail to
perlkom@cyberpomo.com or use the issue tracker at
https://github.com/cdybedahl/perlkom
